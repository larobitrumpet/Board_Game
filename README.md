# Board Game
This is a simple board game that I built when I first started learning python. It is a console application in which you race against another player to get to the end. It includes a number of special spaces that do various things.<br>
A space marked +4 will move you 4 spaces forwards.<br>
A space marked -4 will move you 4 spaces backwards.<br>
A space marked P-\>P will move you to the other player.<br>
A space marked P\<-\>P will switch you and the other player.<br>
A space marked P-\>V will put you in the volcano where you will have to go through extra spaces until you can get back on the main path.
